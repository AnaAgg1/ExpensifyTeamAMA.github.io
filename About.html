								<h3> About Us </h3>
							</header>

							<p> Welcome to Expensify, your number one source for all things related to budgets and saving money. We're dedicated to giving you the very best experience with our MoneyTracker with a focus on dependability, customer service and uniqueness. Team AMA started the foundation, Expensify, because ever since COVID-19’s quarantine has started people have been spending way too much money on subscriptions. People don’t realize at first how much money they are spending each month on subscription services. Ever since quarantine has started the numbers have only been up on the rise with people sitting bored at home with nothing to do and in need of entertainment.</p>
							<p>                                               </p>
							<p> That’s why our team created a Budget Report and a Spending Tracker to ensure that you don’t waste anymore money. The Budget Report gives you a report about how much of your income is being wasted on subscriptions. The Spending Tracker tells you which subscription services you are even subscribed to. A lot of people subscribe to certain services and then forget which ones they even subscribed to or when their monthly fees are due and even sometimes forget when their free trail ends.The Spending Tracker will help with all of this and send regular updates on when fees are due and which services you actually use. </p>
							<p>                                               </p>
							<p> We want to be able to help people around the world save money on subscriptions they don’t use and just save money in general in this crisis. The crisis our world is facing right now is nothing that we have faced before and there are so many people who are wasting money on subscriptions. Expensify will help you save money today! </p>
